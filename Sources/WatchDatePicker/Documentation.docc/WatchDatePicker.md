# ``WatchDatePicker``

A customizable date picker for watchOS and SwiftUI.

## Overview

<!-- TODO: wire up some script to duplicate things from here into README.md -->

> Note: The API exposed by this framework is different from that of SwiftUIâ€™s built-in date picker. When sharing code between multiple platforms, consider using `#if os(watchOS)`, target memberships, or namespaces to disambiguate.
